# solverBL

Uncoupled boundary layer solver. Uncoupled solution of boundary layer equations is not always stable (actually, it is mostly unstable) due to Goldstein's singularity. Stabilization has been implemented, still it requires ad hoc tuning for each airfoil.

Proper documentation to come soon.
